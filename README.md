# Database_Program_In_C

A student record system is another project based on programming language C. 

It also uses files as a database to store the students records & creates index to quickly search the record.
The program is not complete, the reader can download the code and make improvement and also make it complete. 
There are many places for further enhancement. I just uploaded for beginers to learn from it.

Happy computing.
